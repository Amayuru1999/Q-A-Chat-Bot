## 4. Challenges & Limitations

### Technical Challenges

#### 1. Context Relevance and Retrieval Quality

**Challenge Description**: Ensuring that retrieved documents accurately match the semantic intent of user queries, particularly for complex or multi-faceted educational questions.

**Technical Impact**: Poor retrieval quality cascades through the entire pipeline, resulting in irrelevant context being provided to the generation model, which then produces answers that may be factually correct but contextually inappropriate.

**Current Mitigation Approaches**:

- **Multi-stage Retrieval**: Implementation of preliminary filtering followed by semantic re-ranking
- **Query Expansion**: Automatic generation of query variations to capture different phrasings of the same concept
- **Contextual Scoring**: Development of relevance metrics that consider both semantic similarity and topical alignment

**Future Enhancement Plans**:

- **Dynamic Context Windows**: Adaptive context length adjustment based on query complexity
- **User Feedback Integration**: Active learning mechanisms that improve retrieval based on user interactions

#### 2. Handling Query Ambiguity and Multi-Intent Scenarios

**Challenge Description**: Processing queries that can be interpreted in multiple ways or contain implicit context that affects the intended meaning.

**Examples of Problematic Queries**:

- "Explain the mean" (statistical mean vs. general meaning)
- "How do you solve this?" (without clear problem specification)
- "What's the difference?" (requiring context about what is being compared)

**Current Approach**:

- **Context Inference**: Analysis of surrounding conversation for disambiguation cues
- **Clarification Protocols**: Structured follow-up questions when ambiguity is detected
- **Multi-hypothesis Processing**: Generation of multiple interpretations with confidence scoring

**Ongoing Development**:

- **Intent Classification**: Machine learning models trained to identify query types and implicit requirements
- **Dialogue Management**: Conversational systems that can engage in clarification dialogues
- **Context Memory**: Maintenance of conversation history for better disambiguation

#### 3. Hallucination Prevention and Control

**Challenge Description**: Preventing the generation of factually incorrect or fabricated information, especially when the knowledge base lacks relevant information for a query.

**Risk Factors**:

- **Knowledge Gaps**: Queries about topics not covered in the document collection
- **Outdated Information**: Time-sensitive content that may have changed since document creation
- **Cross-domain Confusion**: Mixing concepts from different fields inappropriately

**Current Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Confidence Thresholding**: Rejection of queries when retrieval confidence falls below established thresholds
- **Source Attribution**: Mandatory citation of source materials for all generated content
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Explicit communication when information reliability is questionable

**Advanced Solutions in Development**:

- **Factual Consistency Checking**: Real-time verification of generated content against retrieved sources
- **Knowledge Boundary Detection**: Systems that recognize the limits of their knowledge base
- **Abstention Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation with explicit "I don't know" responses

#### 4. Cross-Domain Performance Consistency

**Challenge Description**: Maintaining consistent response quality across different academic subjects and document types, given varying data quality and coverage.

**Performance Variations Observed**:

- **STEM vs. Humanities**: Technical subjects often have more structured content leading to better retrieval
- **Document Quality**: Scanned documents with OCR errors impact retrieval accuracy
- **Topic Density**: Well-covered topics show significantly better performance than niche subjects

**Balancing Strategies**:

- **Domain-Specific Fine-tuning**: Targeted model improvements for underperforming subject areas
